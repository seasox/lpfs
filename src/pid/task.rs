// /proc/[pid]/task
//
// /proc/[pid]/task (since Linux 2.6.0-test6)
// This  is	a directory that contains one subdirectory for each thread in the process.  The name of each subdirectory is the numerical
// thread ID ([tid]) of the thread (see gettid(2)).	Within each of these subdirectories, there is a set of files with the  same  names
// and  contents  as  under	the  /proc/[pid] directories.  For attributes that are shared by all threads, the contents for each of the
// files under the task/[tid] subdirectories will be the same as in the corresponding file in the parent /proc/[pid]  directory  (e.g.,
// in  a  multithreaded  process,  all  of  the task/[tid]/cwd files will have the same value as the /proc/[pid]/cwd file in the parent
// directory, since all of the threads in a process share a working directory).  For attributes that are distinct for each thread,  the
// corresponding  files  under task/[tid] may have different values (e.g., various fields in each of the task/[tid]/status files may be
// different for each thread).
//
// In a multithreaded process, the contents of the /proc/[pid]/task directory are not available if the main thread has  already  termi-
// nated (typically by calling pthread_exit(3)).
